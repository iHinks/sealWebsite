Future land conversion will continue to expand into relatively undisturbed areas to meet ever-growing human demands for natural resources. Dr. Kunwar Singh studied land conversions, their implications, and nature of the feedback between land conversion and resources under a changing climate using GIS, remote sensing, and spatial statistics. While in the lab, he developed ecohydrological models for water-scarce regions (e.g., the Gangetic Plains in India, and San Joaquin Valley, California in the USA) to understand how agricultural intensification affects the variability of water resources under a changing climate. His educational background includes a doctorate in forestry and environmental resources from NC State, with a focus on quantifying landscape heterogeneity. After finishing his post-doc with SEAL, Dr. Singh moved to the <a href = "https://www.aiddata.org/"> AidData Lab </a> at College of William and Mary.
